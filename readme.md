# Synceta

Synchronize cache writes to persistent storage and display
statistics (like the speed, or the ETA) in the process

Like sync(1), but supports no parameters and displays
a progress bar.

## Why?

I use this mostly when transferring data to FAT formatted USB
sticks or sd cards.

## Usage

```shell
$ cd synceta
$ make # Compilation
$ sudo PREFIX=/usr/local make install # Install in the system
$ synceta
```

## TODO

* Improve signal handling: It should be able to exit easily,
  syncing should continue though
* Make the Progress Bar 'feel' stable
* Clean up all this terrible mathematical code
* Add the few missing comments
* Add packages for arch/ubuntu/debian
